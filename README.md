### What I learned

Without a minimum width, the container will shrink when changing the window size. Plus, it is better to use pixels rather than percentages for margins and other values since they are a fixed value and therefore are better when trying to ensure a fixed position. 

If the margin of a container inside another container is bigger, the content will overflow. Margins have to be equal, or the container inside the other must have a smaller margin. 

### Useful resources

- [% vs. px](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1algy1f/any_way_to_prevent_html_from_moving_when_resizing/) - This helped me understand the difference between percentage and pixels. 
- [Desktop & Mobile view](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69766801/css-body-width-changes-between-desktop-and-mobile) - One line of code helped me with the view on all devices.
- [Collapsed margins](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8529695/adjusting-the-margin-top-of-a-div-inside-of-a-container-div-pushes-both-the-inne) - Overlapping margins solution.
- [Overflowing content inside a div](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11219931/how-to-force-div-element-to-keep-its-contents-inside-container) - Figured out how to ensure content stays inside a container.
